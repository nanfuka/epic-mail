Epic-Mail

Description

The internet is increasingly becoming an integral part of lives. Ever since the invention of electronic mail by Ray Tomlinson, emails have grown to become the primary medium of exchanging information over the internet between two or more people, until the advent of Instant Messaging (IM) Apps. Despite teh growing need, people have not been adquately empowered to adapt to this change.

In order to close this gap, Epic-Mail application has been developed to facilitate the exchange messages/information over the internet.
